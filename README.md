CentOS7OneKeyInstallfor21
=========================

This is a CentOS7 OneKeyInstall key files for 21

I am working in 21......  , they use CentOS7 here for the virtual machine platform, but dont have any baseline here, 
so there are many type of OS installed on the business line.It will be a nightmare for the OS administrators.
I try my best to do this OneKey install ISO to make some change here.

The following thing is the change I am doing:<br/>
1. Change the backgroup splash picture.<br/>
2. Set default strong password for the root and Fine_Fan user.<br/>
3. PermitRootLogint No and change the ssh port to 13290<br/>
4. Disabled the selinux<br/>
5. Add some virt drivers<br/>

There are many things still need to improve.
The current version is V1.9
