CentOS7OneKeyInstallfor21
=========================

This is a CentOS7 OneKeyInstall key files for 21

I am working in 21......  , they use CentOS7 here for the virtual machine platform, but dont have any baseline here, 
so there are many type of OS installed on the business line.It will be a nightmare for the OS administrators.
I try my best to do this OneKey install ISO to make some change here.

The following thing is the change I am doing:
1. Change the backgroup splash picture.
2. Set default strong password for the root and Fine_Fan user.
3. PermitRootLogint No and change the ssh port to 13290
4. Disabled the selinux
5. Add some virt drivers

There are many things still need to improve.
The current version is V1.9
